                <h4 class="aboutDescription">I am currently a full-time Brock University studying computer science with a minor in business. I have a huge passion for technology especially in the areas of cyber security and software/firmware development. Over the years I have worked on my programming abilities in many languages such as Java, Javascript, C#, Lua, and Python through an academic and self-taught journey and a multitude of different personal project. My interest in technology motivates me to seek out new learning opportunities in order to broaden my knowledge and abilities. I am currently learning low-level programming in assembly language as well as the ins and outs of C++. I am also experienced in navigating Linux environments and other operating systems. I am currently seeking a co-op opportunity to apply and refine my skills in a professional setting.<br><br>If you wish to contact me for any reason please reach me at contact@iolivers.com or 289-536-1212</h4>
