For this project I used a Raspberry Pi Zero (Mini Single Board Computer) which would scan for Bluetooth devices in the gym on a set interval. It did this by utilizing a custom python script I wrote along with the bluepy library. Based on the amount of devices it found the code would strategically filter the results and make an accurate estimate on how many people are at the gym and communicate that using an MQTT broker hosted on my virtual private server to the site.</div>
