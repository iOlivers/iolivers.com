                <div class = "projectDescription">This project was designed as a solution to monitoring my fish aquarium water. 
                  A Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Sensor simply quantifies dissolved solids in water and is measures in parts per million. (ppm)
                  It does this by essentially having a probe and outputs a signal based on the conductivity of the water which increases
                  the less "distilled" the water is.
                  <br><br>
                  For this project I used a spare ESP8266 board and programmed it using the Arduino IDE to handle the readings and act as a local web server
                  to display a (fairly) accurate value. Since the TDS sensor is analog (measurement is based on actual voltage) I used an analog-to-digital
                  ADS1115 board as a intermediate step between the sensor and the ESP. <br><br>I calibrated the device by comparing it to plastic bottled mineral water from
                  multiple different brands and tested it until consistently gave me reasonably accurate values when comparing it to the actual ppm level marked on the label of the water
                  bottle.
